# illumi

## Dive right in
Illumi uses the [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) framework for web requests.

Make sure Alamofire is installed
> $ gem install cocoapods

Change into directory where the *Podfile* is located

Install the dependencies by running
> $ pod install

One last thing..

> Use illumi.xcworkspace to make changes instead of illumi.xcodeproj
